## Work Package 2
This work package focuses on research and development to enhance natural language understanding through advanced multilingual LLMs, with an emphasis on safety-critical applications. It also aims to develop efficient methods for handling spontaneous speech and adapting LLMs to the conversational domain, ensuring accurate and meaningful dialogues.

### Submodules

This repository includes the following submodules:
- **FederatedScope**: A submodule dedicated to the research on Federated Learning applied to LLMs and ASR models.
- **llm_adaptation**: A submodule to the developed connector-based method that trains conversationally adept LLMs capable of operating directly on audio.

### Models
- **[Pre-trained models (phase 1-3)](https://zenodo.org/records/14794470)**: Pre-trained models described in deliverable D2.1.
